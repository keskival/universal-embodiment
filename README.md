# Universal Embodiment

Universal Embodiment is a rethinking of classical reinforcement learning principles to be based on
mining of abundant third party experience in heterogeneous signals rather than naively leaning
on ego experience alone.

It is a way to train a foundation model for robotic control which isn't tied to any specific embodiment,
but which can inhabit any robotic body or a machine opportunistically. It is based on in-context learning
of control policies.

Its basic premise is recognizing all agency and intentionality in natural signals, to learn maximally from third-party experience,
side-stepping the RL ego learning bottlenecks.
Ego becomes just a special case of "other".

We will also implicitly get natural expectations of what would others do if they were ego as counter factuals against
robotic ego control signals.
This allows natural recognition of degrees of freedom and the reach of ego in any arbitrary embodiment.
It also allows empathy, better prediction of what others plan and how they will act, and true collaboration in a living world.
The living world is an ocean of agency, not a single-player game for which classic RL was designed for.

## General Principles

All highly developed animals learn from the experience of others, whether others are of the same species, individuals of totally
different species, or even non-living dynamic phenomena. The living world is an ocean of agency which is qualitatively different from
the desert of agency of single player games the traditional reinforcement learning has been designed for. Mining the abundant
agency in the signals from the living world allows learning how to inhabit any body and how to act in the physical world
from abundant bits of information compared to scarce bits of information present in ego learning alone.

Learning from experience of others, and considering ego as just one of the others, allows organic exploitation of observed experience
of others, to generalize to an arbitrary ego embodiment, to quickly learn to take control of any machine body in a purposeful fashion.

Learning control policies should happen in-context rather than on the level of backpropagated learning objectives. This allows
learning and adapting robotic control models faster than with engineered learning rules, which allows quick adaptation to new or changed
embodiments.

# Mining Multi-agent Experience Benchmark

We aim to define a minimal benchmark which measures a capability of an agent in harvesting third party
experience and utilize it.

## Stage 1 - Passive learning

At this stage we show the system a large number of trajectories
in a virtual ecosystem with different kinds of agents with varying goals
and affordances.

## Stage 2 - Embody

The ego agent is embodied to a random agent embodiment in a simulated ecosystem, and
it needs to learn a mapping between its outputs and agent's movements.

The ego agent will be provided a representation of the goal to pursue.

## Problem:

Classical reinforcement learning is too data inefficient to scale meaningfully to heterogeneous machine embodiments in the world of ubiquitous robotics.

## Solution:

#UniversalEmbodiment is a set of methods which realign classical reinforcement learning to a living world which is an ocean of agency.

Classical reinforcement learning is data inefficient as it's based on ego learning. We have data-driven methods for mining third party experience from a living world and utilize it to design and control real world machinery.

In short, this allows lightning fast adaptation to new or degraded physical bodies with organically learned control algorithms without a need for trial and error learning which is prohibitively costly and slow for physical bodies.

This can be done with AI models able to see themselves in the role of others, and learn from this, from the treasure trove of living agency that is the real world.

For this, we have a team of founders ready, and it's possible to start work to create prototypes with an initial seed funding of 16 M€ for the first 1-2 years, aiming for 160 M€ capital to develop real world applications in the domains of:

- Space, ocean, underground exploration
- Disasters and rescue
- Military and defence
